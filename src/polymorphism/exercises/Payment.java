/**
 TODO:
 1. Create a superclass Payment with method pay(double amount).
 2. Create subclasses:
      - CreditCardPayment (prints "Paid <amount> using Credit Card").
      - PayPalPayment (prints "Paid <amount> using PayPal").
      - CashPayment (prints "Paid <amount> in cash").
 3. In main():
      - Create a List<Payment>.
      - Add different payment types.
      - Loop and call pay() → each behaves differently.
